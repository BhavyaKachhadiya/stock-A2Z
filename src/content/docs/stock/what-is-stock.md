# Understanding Stocks

A stock represents a share of ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you're purchasing a small piece of that company, becoming a shareholder. This ownership gives you certain rights and the potential to benefit from the company's success.

## How Stocks Work

When a company wants to raise money, it can issue stocks through a process called an Initial Public Offering (IPO). This allows investors to buy shares of the company, providing the company with capital for growth while giving investors the opportunity to participate in the company's future success.

## Types of Stocks

### Common Stock
- Most basic and widely-known type of stock
- Provides voting rights at shareholder meetings
- May pay dividends (share of profits)
- Higher risk but potentially higher returns

### Preferred Stock
- Hybrid between stocks and bonds
- Usually pays fixed dividends
- Limited or no voting rights
- Less price volatility than common stock
